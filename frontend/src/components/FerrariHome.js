     <p className="brandinfo">Ferrari builds cars unique in terms of their performance, innovations, technology, driving pleasure and design.
      Cars acknowledged the world over as the pinnacle of Made in Italy achievement.Ferrari desigsn and build all their cars in Maranello, Italy, but they sell them in over 60 markets worldwide through a network of 180 authorised dealers. 
      Ferrari supports the Ferrari legend and brand by organising a plethora of initiatives for our clients and fans, both in Maranello and across the world. They also do in other ways, such as signing licencing agreements with select partners to develop the lines of products sold in the Ferrari Stores and to allow the creation of Ferrari museums and theme parks.   The Ferrari logo with its iconic Prancing Horse symbolizes Italian luxury, exclusivity, performance, design and quality the world over.
      Each Ferrari car is unique. But as a whole, they form a single family built thanks to a long expertise in engineering and driving performance. The design of each Ferrari vehicle draws inspiration from the Scuderia Ferrari in Formula 1, Gran Turismo or Sports prototypes. All the sports cars models have the same start lineâ€”a passion for competition that has inspired the inimitable technique and design Ferrari calls its own.
