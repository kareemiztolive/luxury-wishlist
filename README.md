The luxury wishlist app is a an app made by a luxury car enthusiast for other luxury car enthusiasts.
The app allows you to browse several luxury car brands and save your favorite cars to your own profile. 
All of the information that is important to you as a luxury car lover is here so you can browse and learn about all the different types of cars before you save them to you profile.

This project was structured in a way that would allow anyone to clone down this repository to their own computer and add as many different luxury car brands and cars as they want.
The brands used for this demonstration of the project are Mercedes Benz,BMW,Lamborghini,Ferrari,and Rolls Royce. I love a lot more car brands and cars than the ones that are displayed in this project,
although the car brands listed above are easily some of the most recognizable luxury and exotic car brands out there. If you want to seed the backend database with your favorite luxury and exotic cars
that is always an option. All you have to do is navigate to the backend folder and edit the seed file that is there, and run the seed file again. Your favorite cars will be there.
The more cars you love,the more you can add to the seed file.You can have as many cars as you want!
This part of the project was done deliberately to give all car lovers the ability to customize the app however they want.
